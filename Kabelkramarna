"""                              ### Description ###.  

This script is part of the Kabelkramarna project, which aims to develop a network scanner tool.
The tool will scan local networks to identify connected devices and their open ports.
The project is a collaborative effort by a group of students to enhance their understanding of network protocols
and socket programming in Python.
also practice error handling (timeouts, connection refused, OSError), performance considerations, 
and result documentation all while emphasizing ethical and legal responsibility in network scanning.
